> A landing page already exists at `landing/index.html`. This document provides refined copy and content strategy.

## Hero Section

**Headline:** Export Figma Prototypes as Professional Videos

**Subheadline:** Turn your interactive prototypes into shareable MP4 and GIF videos in seconds. No screen recording, no editing — just one click.

**CTA:** Install Free Plugin →

**Secondary CTA:** See How It Works ↓

## Problem Statement

> "I need to share my prototype with stakeholders who don't have Figma access."

Screen recording is tedious. You fight with crop settings, cursor position, and screen clutter. The result looks unprofessional.

**ProtoVid captures your prototype flow automatically** — every frame, every transition — and exports a clean, high-quality video.

---

## How It Works (3 Steps)

1. **Open your prototype** — ProtoVid auto-detects all frames and interactions
2. **Choose your settings** — Resolution, frame rate, format (MP4/GIF)
3. **Export** — Download a polished video ready to share

## Deployment Notes

1. Host on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages
2. Point a custom domain (e.g., protovid.app) to it
3. Update Lemon Squeezy checkout links with real product URLs
4. Add analytics (Plausible or Simple Analytics recommended for privacy)
